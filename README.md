  ## Data Analysis
  Looking into the participant dataset, I started by calculating the total number of participants for the Data Analysis class. I was curious to know the gender makeup, so I analyzed the number of males and females with cards. I found out the class had more females than males. To understand the marital status of participants that attended the class, I visualized the status with charts. I discovered that more singles registered for class, followed by married and then divorced. By exploring the location, I could see where students came from. Lagos had the highest number of participants followed by Ogun state and one person each from Anambra, Kogi, Niger and Rivers. A table was also created to see the participants name, gender, unique code and email address. I looked at the educational backgrounds and discovered that the most common level of education attained by the participants was HND/BSc ( Higher National Diploma/ Bachelor of Science) followed by MSc( Master of Science) and the least level was SSCE(Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination).For the occupation, I discovered that more self-employed participants registered for the class.
